# nn_temp_compression
This repository contains the program used to simulate the temporal compression scenarios discussed in "A Neural Network Based Asymmetrical Compression System for IoT Networks" written by Mateus S. Gilbert and Miguel Elias M. Campista. From parameters set on "t2_taxonomy.py", the program trains the listed autoencoder networks to perform the compression task at hand.

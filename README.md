# Temperature Compression using Neural Networks
This repository contains the program used to simulate the temporal compression scenarios discussed in "A Neural Network Based Asymmetrical Compression System for IoT Networks" written by Mateus S. Gilbert and Miguel Elias M. Campista. From parameters set on "t2_taxonomy.py", the program trains the listed autoencoder networks to perform the compression task at hand.

The code present here was mainly written by myself, with the following exceptions:

  (1) lr_finder_keras.py, available at https://github.com/WittmannF/LRFinder;
  
  (2) clr_callback.py, available at https://github.com/bckenstler/CLR.

Also, the files containing the temperature measurements used in the experiment where generated from a dataset available at https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.6071/M39Q2V.
